# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain number of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

\
This is a project from AiCore to learn and understand working with the basics of object oriented programming principles using python scripts. Hangman game is created step by step in 5 different milestones.



## Milestone 1

This milestone gives an overview on the version control systems. In this project we use Git and GitHub for this purpose. 
`hangman` repository is created in the GitHub.

Git is a distributed version control system that manages multiple versions of source code and record them into a repository. GitHub is the cloud-based platform used in this project. It serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository for collaboration.

Bash terminal in the VSCode is a platform used to run all the commands for Git and for running the python script.

Below are some basic commands that we frequently use in the bash terminal.

- ```git clone``` command clones the `hangman` repository in the GitHub to the bash terminal in the local machine.


- ```git add``` and ```git commit``` commands are frequently used to stage changes and commit them to the 'hangman' repository.
 
- ```git push``` command is used to push the committed changes in the  local repository to the GitHub repository.

- ```touch``` command is used to create a file within 'hangman' repository.

Vim is the source-code editor in the Bash terminal used to edit and update the python scripts and README file.

## Milestone 2

A random word is picked by the machine and the player will have to guess that word. The random word is generated from the `word_list` (list of words). This is performed by importing the `random` module.

```
import random
word_list = ['Apple', 'Plum', 'Grapes', 'Orange', 'Pineapple']
print(word_list)
word = random.choice(word_list)
print(word)
```

This image shows the random word selrcted by the machine from the list of words using the random module

\
The player is asked to enter the letter. This is done using the `input` function.`len` function and `isalpha` method is used to validate the input by making sure that only a single alphabet is entered.

```
guess = input('Please enter a single letter here: ')
if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():
    print("Good guess!")
else:
    print("Oops! That is not a valid input.")
```

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/3_len_isalpha_output.png" width = "300" height = "37" />


## Milestone 3

If the player enters an invalid input, then the player is asked to enter again. This continues until a valid input is entered. This is performed within `ask_for_input` function. This function asks the player to input a single alphalet and validates it. `while loop` is used to repeat asking the player to enter a single letter until a valid input is entered.

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/4_loop_until_valid_input.png" width = "450" height = "120" />

Here we can see the loop repeating until a single alphabet is entered by the player.

\
The guessed letter is then assigned to a variable `guess` and `check_guess` function is called by passing `guess` as its parameter. 
`guess` is compared with the word generated by the machine to check if the guessed letter is in the word. This is performed by `check_guess` functions.

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/5_good_guess.png" width = "300" height = "37" />

`check_guess` function checks if the guessed letter `guess` is in the word or not using `if statement`. and prints that it is a good guess if the letter is present else prints that the letter is not in the word.

## Milestone 4
This project uses the object-oriented programming principles to create this game. 

`Hangman` class is created. The `check_guess` and `ask_for_input` methods are defined in this class. 

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/6_init_method.png" width = "450" height = "180" />

Using `__init__` method the attributes are initialized.

\
`list_of_guesses` is a list of letters that are already guessed. In the `check_guess` method the `list_of_guesses` is updated, whenever a letter is guessed. 

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/7_list_of_guesses.png" width = "300" height = "70" />

While asking for the input the `ask_for_input` method checks if the guessed letter is repeated by comparing the guessed letter in `list_of_guesses`. If the letter is already guessed, a message is printed saying that the letter is already guessed.


`num_letter` is a integer which tells how many unique letters are there in a word. Each time the letter in the word is guessed correctly the `num_letter` is reduced by 1 within the `check_guess` method.

`word_guessed` is a list with underscores '`_`'. The number of these underscores is equal to the length of the word.
For example: if the `word` is pineapple. The length of pineapple is 9.
Hence `word_guessed` is `['_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_']`
Each time the letter is guessed correctly the `'_'` is replaced by that letter
For example, if `guess` is `n` the `word_guessed` will be updated to `['_', '_', 'n', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_', '_']`. 
For this operation I have used the `enumerate` function where the index of the letters of the `word` is located and hence the '`_`' is replaced by those letters.

```
for index, letter in enumerate(self.word):
    if guess == letter:
        self.word_guessed[index] = guess
```

A player has 5 lives. Each time the player guesses the letter wrong, life is reduced. Hence `num_lives` is reduced when the player guesses the letter wrong.

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/8_numlife4.png" width = "270" height = "250" />

## Milestone 5

`play_game` function starts the game by check the number of lives the player has and the number of letter to be guessed, with `word_list` as its parameter. `game` is an instance of class `Hangman` defined within `play_game`.

If the `num_lives` is greater than 0 then the game is started. `ask_for_input` method is called until `num_lives` is equals to 0.
If the player has one or more lives and if all the letters in the word are guessed then the Player wins the game.
If the player has lost all the lives then the player loses the game.

## Colour to `print` 
Addition to these milestones I have added some more features to this game.

To make this game a little more colourful I have imported `Fore` from the `colorama` module. This adds colour to the print statement.

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/12_colour.png" width = "360" height = "300" />


## Hangman visuals
I have added `hangman_visuals` method inside the class `Hangman` that will show the hangman visual everytime the player loses a life.

For this I have created a list and each element is a docstring. Each element shows various stages of visual of hangman.
hangman_lives = [

                """
        ________
        ¦     ¦
        ¦     O
        ¦    \¦/
        ¦     ¦
        ¦    / \

        """,

        """ , 

            """

        ¦
        ¦
        ¦___________

        """

This method prints `hangman_lives[num_lives]`. The list indexing is done such that when `num_lives` is 4, the `hangman_lives[4]` is displayed, when `num_lives` is 3, the `hangman_lives[3]` is displayed and so on.

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TellisAshwini/hangman/main/Images/8_numlife4.png" width = "270" height = "250" />

Here we can see the `hangman_lives[4]` is displayed when then number of lives are 4.

This is how the hangman game is created in steps. This projects is not just fun to build but also gives strong foundantion on the OOP concept.
